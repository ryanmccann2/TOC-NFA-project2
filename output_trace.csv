This is the file that contains the NFA trace for N3-fig. 1.34.
This will be an example of trace_DarkLamp program which traces an NFA and shows possible paths for the NFA given a string.

NFA:
States: {'q1': 1, 'q2': 2, 'q3': 3, 'q4': 4, 'q5': 5, 'q6': 6}
Sigma: {'0'}\Start State: q1
Final States: 
q2
q4
DELTA: 
('q1', '~', 'q2')
('q1', '~', 'q4')
('q2', '0', 'q3')
('q2', '~', 'q3')
('q3', '0', 'q2')
('q4', '0', 'q5')
('q5', '0', 'q6')
('q5', '~', 'q6')
('q6', '0', 'q4')

All possible paths below:

These are all paths that make it to a final state:


The number of leaves on tree was 0.
The number of leaves in final state was 0
